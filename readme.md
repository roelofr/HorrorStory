# Horror Story - A Garry's Mod gamemode

**WARNING:** If you are *not* a developer or beta tester, please use the stable
releases available on the [Steam Workshop][workshop]! This repository might contain
very instable code and could cause conflicts with regular clients!

----

You've reached the source code repository for Horror Story. Here you can read
some docs, check out the source code and help make this addon even greater than
it currently is.

## Installation

Please read the [Installation guide](docs/installation.md).
For plugins, please read the [Plugin installation guide](docs/plugins.md).

## License

The entire project is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](LICENSE)
and by committing code to this repository you agree to apply this license onto
your work.

### Exceptions

Any plugins which are created are not part of this license, since they can be
stored separately from the gamemode itself (in `/lua/plugins/horror-story` or
`/addon/<name>/lua/plugins/horror-story`). You are, however, free to commit these
to `/available-plugins.md`.

## Help development

If you want to help me out, feel free to pick up an issue or, if you have an
addition, create an issue about a missing feature or unreported bug and claim it.
This is to prevent multiple people working on the same problem without knowing it.

When you're done, please create a merge request. Make sure you insert your name
into `/AUTHORS` when committing, unless you want to waive your copyright and
credit.

## Publications to the Steam Workshop

To prevent various different ports of Horror Story, a plugin system was developed
which allows anyone to hook into practically any Garry's Mod or Horror Story hook.
Please see `/docs/plugins.md` for more info.

Because of this plugin system, we would kindly ask you not to create your own
copy of Horror Story on the Steam Workshop. If you want to be added as a
contributor, please add [SirQuackTheDuck][steam-sirquack] on Steam and ask me.

## Credits

This gamemode uses works from other people, all licenses are included and most of
the credits can be found in the [credits file](resource/credits.md).
